**MSFS-PyScriptManager** is a tool designed for running custom Python scripts tailored for Microsoft Flight Simulator (MSFS). This tool leverages the [WinPython](https://github.com/winpython) portable Python environment for an easy installation.  Simply download the release and extract it â€” no further installation is required to run the included scripts!

**Comes with several useful scripts, such as:**
- [virtual_pos_printer.py](#virtual-pos-printer-for-fenix-a32x---virtual_pos_printerpy)- displays print jobs as popups on the screen from the Fenix A32x printer.
- [custom_status_bar.py](#custom-status-bar---custom_status_barpy)- shows a status bar that can dynamically pull information from the sim and Simbrief.
- [fenix_lights.py](#other-scripts) - pre-configures flight deck lighting in A32x and optionally binds joystick axis to screen brightness.
- **No Python programming knowledge is required** to run the included scripts!

# Download
- [Download MSFS-PyScriptManager(Release Page)](https://github.com/cgtrout/MSFS-PyScriptManager/releases/)
- [Virus Total Malware Check](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/url/9f2aab0754a63dc92903b3c99db9cf5dde639241368af9c33f51053997d20333?nocache=1)

# Installation Instructions
- Download the ZIP file from the newest release (Releases).
- Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a location of your choice. Tip: Use a fast unzip tool such as [7-zip](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html) as the default Windows ZIP extraction tool is very slow at extracting the WinPython directory.
- Feel free to post an 'issue' here on Github if you have any issues with the launcher or the scripts.

# How to use the Launcher
- Run `MSFS-PyScriptManager.exe` - this will open the python script manager/launcher.
- Click the "Run Script" button to open a script. Running scripts are each shown in their own individual tabs.
- Right click the tab header for a given script to close it.
- Further details on the provided scripts are included further down.
- For more information on how to use the Launcher see: [Launcher Guide](Docs/Launcher_guide.md)

# Included Scripts
## **Virtual Pos Printer for Fenix A32x - virtual_pos_printer.py:**
   - Allows print jobs from the Fenix A32x to show as popup 'notes' on the screen.
   - [Virtual Printer Guide](Docs/virtual_pos_printer.md) - please read this guide for further instructions on how to use.

## Custom Status Bar - custom_status_bar.py:
  - Shows a customizable draggable status bar that shows the real world zulu time and sim zulu time, along with a countdown timer (that can also fetch times from Simbrief).
  - [Custom Status Bar Guide](Docs/custom_status_bar.md) - please read the guide for more information on how to use this script.

## Notes on Mobiflight Integration
- Several of the scripts listed below require the Mobiflight WASM module.  Each in the list below is marked if it requires this WASM module.
- This WASM module can be downloaded here: https://github.com/MobiFlight/MobiFlight-WASM-Module/releases/tag/1.0.1.  Download the ZIP and extract to your community folder.  Alternatively, if you have MobiFlight Connector installed, you can install this module with the top menu command (Extras > Microsoft Flight Simulator > Install WASM Module)

## Other Scripts
- **fbw_a380_checklist.py** Allows keyboard control of built in A380 checklist.  This script requires a [Mobiflight "WASM" module installation](https://github.com/MobiFlight/MobiFlight-Connector/wiki/Verifying-the-WASM-module-installation-and-locating-the-MSFS2020-community-folder).
- **fenix_disable_efb.py:** Hides the EFBs on the Fenix A32x when run. (Requires Mobiflight "WASM" module installation).
- **fenix_radio.py:** Shows a draggable radio panel that shows A32x RMP1 active/standby channels. (Requires Mobiflight "WASM" module installation).
- **fenix_lights.py:** Preassign flight deck lighting knob values.  Also allows one knob to control all screen brightness or to optionally bind a joystick axis to control screen lighting. This will also reset all of the lights to get around the MSFS 2024 'full bright' lighting bug.  (Requires Mobiflight "WASM" module installation).
- **metar_load.py:** Load a historical metar based on Simulator or real world time - can print to virtual_pos_printer.
- **plot_altitude.py:** Shows a draggable graph panel of altitude - can easily be changed to other SimConnect variables.  Can also export recorded data as CSV.
- **plot_joystick.py:** Show visualization of joystick and trim values state. Will either show heli or plane trims dynamically.

# Note On Included Script Behavior
Currently, **most of the included scripts will detect Simulator state**.  However, in certain scenarios, such as starting a new flight (second+ flight of the session) may may need to restart some/all of the scripts.  Please use **one** of the following methods:
1. Click "Reload All" in `MSFS-PyScriptManager.exe` after your aircraft has fully loaded in MSFS.
2. Wait until you are loaded in the flight before opening `MSFS-PyScriptManager.exe`.  This will also ensure that scripts are able to connect and initialize as expected.

# MSFS 2024 Update
 - All scripts should work with MSFS 2024, but please report any issues.
 - The community addon for the print-out toolbar works without modifications in MSFS 2024. The installation script has been updated for automated installation; however, it has not been tested with the Microsoft Store version.

# Script Groups
- "Script Groups" can be used to automate loading groups of scripts at once.
- Save your script group as `_autoplay.script_group` to automate loading your script group at startup.

# Technical Notes
- The launcher EXE is provided for convenience, but you can also launch the script manually.  It is also possible to launch the script "/Launcher/Launcher.py" from "WinPython/WinPython Command Prompt.exe" if you prefer to not launch from the EXE.  The exe can be built by launching "Build.bat" in "\Launcher\LauncherApp" as the "TCC" C-Compiler is included(https://bellard.org/tcc/).
- You can easily create your own scripts and run them as well.  Note that if you need to add any libraries use the "WinPython/WinPython Command Prompt.exe" and run the "pip" command from here to add a library to the WinPython directory.
- I recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) for editing the scripts.  The built in "Edit" button will open the selected script in VS Code if it is installed.
- Uses WinPython to allow standalone installation - https://github.com/winpython
