# Virtual Printer Community Guide Addon Guide

This document will explain how to install and use the optional community addon.  This community addon will allow printouts from the "virtual_pos_printer" script to show in a MSFS toolbar for those in VR.  I'd only recommend this for those in VR as there are limitations to what can be done with a MSFS toolbar.

# Usage Guide
- Note that this must remain open for messages to be received.  Double click the "Printouts" header if you want to minimize it.
- Arrows on left/right will move through messages.  Trash-can will delete current message.
- It is critical that the "virtual_pos_printer" script remains running as this handles the communication between the virtual printer and the MSFS addon.
