# Virtual Printer Script (virtual_pos_printer.py)
 - This will automatically create a "Fake" network Windows printer called "VirtualTextPrinter".
  - Set the printer in the Fenix EFB settings to use the "VirtualTextPrinter" created by the script.

  - Has an optional community toolbar addon for those in VR see: [Community Addon Guide](https://github.com/cgtrout/MSFS-PyScriptManager/blob/main/Docs/Community_Addon_Guide.md)
  - Note that this script **must** be running for the print functionality to work as it functions as a print server.
  - There is a script called "virtual_pos_TEST.py" that can be run to test the printer.  Run this in conjunction with the "virtual_pos_printer" script to test.  If everything is working correctly you should see popups with a test message every five seconds.  Close the test script to end the testing.
  - Notes can be dragged with left mouse click (hold).  Right-click to close a note.
  - Use Ctrl+MouseWheel up/down to resize a note (with mouse cursor on top of note).
  - Use Ctrl+Shift+P shortcut to define a new note spawning location (it will use the current mouse position).
  - If you have any issues with the automated printer installation see this guide: [Printer Troubleshooting Guide](https://github.com/cgtrout/MSFS-PyScriptManager/blob/main/Docs/Printer_Troubleshooting_Guide.md)
