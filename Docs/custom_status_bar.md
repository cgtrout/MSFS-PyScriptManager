- This script will show a customizable status bar that pulls information dynamically from SimConnect and Simbrief
- Uses an easily modifiable 'template' system to define variables that show on the bar.  On first run, a file will be created at /Settings/status_bar_templates.py.  This file can be modified to create multiple templates.  Documentation for this is provided in the status_bar_tepmlates.py file.
